/**
 * The annotation is intended to instruct Cassandra to create a secondary index for the field with annotated getter/setter
 * of the persistable bean.<br/>
 * <ul>Please note, that Cassandra has restrictions on secondary index:
 * <li>Not recommended for high cardinality values (i.e.timestamps,birthdates,keywords,etc.) </li>
 * <li>Unsorted-results are in token order,not query value order </li>
 * <li>Limited to search on datatypes Cassandra natively understands </li>
 * <li>you can NOT use secondary index with super column.</li>
 * <li>index name must be unique across column families of the whole keyspace.</li>
 *  </ul>
